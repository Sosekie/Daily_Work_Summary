# TODO List

## 3/27/2025

- ViSER

The reference to “ViSER [YSJ21b] (from scratch)” in the chat suggests a desire for a more complete, from-scratch exposition of the key ideas and contributions of this approach.

- BANMo

BANMo [YVN22]” was included, along with its use of Continuous Surface Embeddings (labeled [NNS20] in the chat). The teacher wants a more in-depth or systematic description, not just a surface mention.

- LASSIE (DINO)

Mentioned separately again by the teacher, stating that he/she would like to see the idea of this paper, the mechanism of combining it with large-scale characterization models such as DINO, etc.

- Dense Tracking series

Includes “\cite{Cho_2024_CVPR, harley2022particle, CoTracker24, TAPIR, TrackingEverythingEverywhere, faster, etc}” in the citation. These articles focus on approaches in the field of “long-term dense tracking” or “arbitrary point tracking”, and I look forward to comparing and explaining these works more fully in a review.

- Generic 3D Models from Videos

Include BANMo, LASR, ViSER, DOVE, etc. Indicate that the instructor would like to have a subsection or a dedicated section that compares and summarizes how these methods model general-purpose 3D objects (human bodies or other objects) from video and explores their differences or connections in terms of visualization, editability, etc.

### Main Object:

1. Forward the Master Thesis Form;
2. For PlantDream, continue to complete:
    1. Data cleaning – review [Nvidia](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.03575v1)'s data processing method;
    2. LTX fine-tuning;
    3. Train PlantDream using only SDS to observe the outcome;
    4. Complete all code and experiments within two weeks.
3. Write a review, covering three directions:
    1. Long Time Dense Tracking:

        - [Mast3r](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.09756)
    2. Monocular Non-rigid Reconstruction:
        - [Recent Trends in 3D Reconstruction of General Non-Rigid Scenes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.15064)
        - [State of the Art in Dense Monocular Non-Rigid 3D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.15664)
    3. 3D Controllable Deformation
